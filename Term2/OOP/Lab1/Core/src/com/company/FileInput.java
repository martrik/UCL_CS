This is a subclass of * <code>Input</code> that hides the exceptions that can happen when opening a file.  As with * <code>Input</code> all errors during use of the iterator result in a message output to the * standard error and program termination. * <p/> * <p>This class is useful for people new to Java since it allows them to write programs using * input from a file without having to fully understand the read / parse / handle exceptions model * of the standard Java classes.  Once exceptions and object chaining are covered this class * ought not to be used, it is definitely just an "early stepping stone" utility class for initial * learning.</p> * * @author Russel Winder * @version 2005-08-10 */public class FileInput extends Input {  /**   * Construct <code>FileInput</code> object given a file name.   */  public FileInput(final String fileName)  {    try    {      scanner = new Scanner(new FileInputStream(fileName));    }    catch (FileNotFoundException fnfe)    {      System.err.println("File " + fileName + " could not be found.");      System.exit(1);    }  }  /**   * Construct <code>FileInput</code> object given a file name.   */  public FileInput(final FileInputStream fileStream)  {    super(fileStream);  }}
